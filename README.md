This is a simple concession program for creating a concession receipt.

Clicking the plus and minus buttons to the corresponding items will increase or decrease the amount in the receipt by the amount in the field in between the buttons.
The calculation is live and all totals are updated with each button click.
The Clear button clears all totals back to zero and the fields to one.
The Exit button closes the program.
